            "a": "While identifying and fixing defects is important, the primary goal of ATDD is to ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements.",
            "b": "Correct. The primary goal of ATDD is to ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements by specifying acceptance criteria for each user story or feature and then designing, developing, and testing the software to meet those criteria.",

            "c": "Correct. The customer or product owner is a key stakeholder in the ATDD process and is responsible for participating in the planning, design, and review of the acceptance tests to ensure that they accurately reflect the desired behavior and meet the business objectives.",

            "d": "ATDD may provide greater visibility and collaboration between developers and stakeholders, but it does not necessarily lead to greater developer autonomy.",

            "c": "While it is important to consider automation when writing acceptance tests, the primary focus should be on ensuring that the tests accurately reflect the desired behavior.",
            "d": "Using non-specific test criteria can make it difficult to determine whether the software is meeting the customer's requirements.",
            "e": "Correct. Including negative test scenarios, which test what should not happen as well as what should happen, can help uncover defects and edge cases that might not be caught by positive test scenarios alone."

        "explanations": {
            "a": "Developing the acceptance tests after the software has been developed goes against the principles of ATDD, which emphasizes writing the acceptance tests first and using them to guide development.",
            "b": "Developing the acceptance tests during the sprint retrospective is too late in the process to incorporate them effectively into the development process.",
            "c": "Correct. Developing the acceptance tests before the sprint planning meeting ensures that the tests are developed collaboratively by the development team and the customer or product owner and that they are used to guide the development process during the sprint.",
            "d": "Developing the acceptance tests during the sprint may not provide enough time for the development team to fully understand the customer's requirements and develop the software accordingly.",
